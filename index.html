    <h3>Why am I interested in <a href = "http://www.utexas.edu/"> UT</a>?</h3>
       
    <p>The University of Texas at Austin interests me because of the education provided, the greek life, and the city. UT Austin gives an amazing education from the variety of classes available to the rigorous course lessons. It prepares their students to make smart life decisions, and helps them be able to maintain jobs. The hard classes teach UT students much more than easy, regular classes. The greek life is also very popular at UT. It provides students with automatic life-long friends and helps them have a better experience at college. Austin is also a very fun and exciting city to live in. There constantly are music, food, and movies festivals, which are enjoyable and fun for college students.  </p>

    <h3>Why am I interested in <a href = "http://www.sandiego.edu/"> USD</a>?</h3>
         
    <p>I am interested in USD because of its location and preparation for the future. USD is located in San Diego, California. With beaches near by and perfect weather all year long, anyone who lives there will be comfortable, tan, and happy. USD also prepares its students for the future very well. Because it is located in San Diego, the students must be able to live on their own, idependently. They also must be prepared to hold a job so that they can pay for their housing outside of college. Being in California, many opportunities also arise for eager USD students.</p>

    <h3>Why am I interested in <a href = "https://www.fordham.edu/"> Fordham</a>?</h3>
    
    <p>I am interested in Fordham because of its beautiful location, rigorous courses, and challenging Law program. Fordham is located in The Bronx, New York. It is in one of the most populated states in the country. This means that there are various job opportunities and options for any majors or interests. Fordham is also a very pritigous college. It has challenging classes, preparing its students for their future outside of college. One of Fordham's main majors is their Law program. It is extremely challenging, but creates once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for your future.</p>
